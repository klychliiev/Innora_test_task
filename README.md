# Innora_test_task

## Project contents 
* invoices_rotated - folder containing rotated images for testing the algorithm
* angle_detection.py - script to detect the rotation angles of input images
* predicted_angles.json - the file generated by the angle_detection.py script containing image path as a key and a predicted rotation angle as a value
* requirements.txt - libraries used in the project
* main.ipynb - notebook with additional comments (no need to run)

## Run the program 

Write the following commands in the terminal to run the program:<br>
$ python3 -m venv env <br>
$ source env/bin/activate<br>
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br>
$ python3 angle_detection.py<br>

The output of the last command should be as follows:<br>
invoices_rotated/0.png: 7<br>
invoices_rotated/1.png: -2<br>
invoices_rotated/2.png: -9<br>
invoices_rotated/3.png: -7<br>
invoices_rotated/4.png: -1<br>
invoices_rotated/5.png: -6<br>
invoices_rotated/6.png: 5<br>
invoices_rotated/7.png: -2<br>
invoices_rotated/8.png: -4<br>
invoices_rotated/9.png: -1<br>
invoices_rotated/10.png: -4<br>
